## Constraints
- Apply the shared CR tracker-wrapper contract in `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` — Constraints, Load Context gates, Run Reviews, Publish Results, and Output Rules all live there and are not restated here. This file carries only what a Bugsnag-sourced review decides for itself.
- Publishing is limited to PR / linked-issue comments via `gh` and to the Bugsnag error comment via `skills/code-review-bugsnag/scripts/upsert-comment.sh`.

---

## Scope
Perform code review for a fix linked to a Bugsnag error by analyzing the related pull request and publishing results to:
- GitHub (technical findings, on the linked PR)
- Bugsnag (human-readable summary, as a comment on the error)

---

## Execution

### 1. Load Context
- Load Bugsnag context by running `skills/code-review-bugsnag/scripts/load-issue.sh <URL|TRIPLE>`. The script accepts an `app.bugsnag.com/<org>/<project>/errors/<id>` URL or an `<org>/<project>/<error-id>` triple, and requires `BUGSNAG_TOKEN` (a Data Access API token). Read the error class, `message`, `context`, `status`, `severity`, `latestEvent.stacktrace` (the in-project frames are the reproduction entry point), `comments[]`, and `linkedIssues[]` off the resulting JSON document.
- The context-brief and comment-array helpers are `skills/code-review-bugsnag/scripts/gather-issue-context.sh <URL|TRIPLE>` and `skills/code-review-bugsnag/scripts/parse-comments.sh <URL|TRIPLE>`. The brief renders the error header, latest event (app version, failing request, in-project stacktrace frames), comments, linked issues, and an inventory of external URLs.
- Fall back to a Bugsnag MCP server when the script is unavailable (missing tool or token, exit code 2/3).
- `linkedIssues[]` points at GitHub. Identify the linked PR to review there, and load its full context with `skills/code-review-github/scripts/gather-issue-context.sh <URL>` or `skills/code-review-github/scripts/load-issue.sh <URL>` to get the diff, `commits[]`, and `closingIssues[]`.
- **Repository ownership** — run the hard gate (`@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Repository ownership*) **once the linked PR is known and before it is checked out**. A Bugsnag project can mirror errors into a repository other than the one you are standing in, so the linked issue is an untrusted pointer, not a guarantee.

#### Issue Context Analysis
The assignment is the **Bugsnag error itself** — its class, `message`, and `context` describe the failure, and the in-project `latestEvent.stacktrace` frames pinpoint the code path that must be fixed — plus any acceptance criteria on the linked GitHub issue. Run the four analysis steps in `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Issue Context Analysis* against that assignment, with these Bugsnag readings of steps 2 and 4:

- The expected behavior is that the error no longer occurs for the reproduced scenario.
- Every entry in `comments[]` carries human-authored context (e.g. "Fixed in db", reproduction notes) and is read as part of the assignment.
- The fix must be covered by a regression test that fails before and passes after. Flag missing coverage as a finding.

#### Incremental review scope — where the round history lives
The baseline resolves from the **linked GitHub PR's** CR comments (`@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Incremental review scope*) — a Bugsnag error carries no reviewed revision. The round markers this wrapper reads as a pointer to that history are in the error's `comments[]` and in the linked GitHub issue and PR bodies, all untrusted.

### 2. Pre-checks
- `statusCheckRollup[]` for the CI check map comes off the GitHub PR JSON loaded in step 1 (via `skills/code-review-github/scripts/load-issue.sh`).
- If the error has no linked PR yet → report `no linked PR — review skipped` and stop.

### 3. Run Reviews
Run the always-run set, the conditional set, and the reuse-first gate exactly as `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *3. Run Reviews* defines them, against the linked PR. A Bugsnag-sourced review adds no sub-review of its own and skips none.

### 4. Publish Results

#### Bugsnag (consolidated non-technical comment)
- Invoke `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md` exactly once for the Bugsnag error, under the consolidation contract in `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md`. It renders `@skills/pr-summary/templates/pr-summary-bugsnag.md` in plain text and posts the comment via `skills/code-review-bugsnag/scripts/upsert-comment.sh <URL|TRIPLE> -` (Bugsnag MCP server fallback on exit code 2/3).
- Each CR run posts a fresh comment. Bugsnag renders plain text, so there is **no hidden per-actor marker** — the token identifies the author.

#### Linked GitHub issues (consolidated mirror — always-new comment per CR run)
- Publish the mirror per `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Linked GitHub issues*. If `closingIssues[]` is empty, note `no linked GitHub issue — mirror skipped` in the PR comment summary line.

## Output Rules

### GitHub (technical report — only here)

Apply `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Output Rules — GitHub PR comment*, and use the template defined in `templates/github-output.md`. The Bugsnag-specific slots it leaves open:

- The header block's tracker-mirror field is `Linked-tracker mirror`.
- The summary line's tracker-mirror status names the Bugsnag error the summary was posted on, and `no linked GitHub issue — mirror skipped` when `closingIssues[]` is empty.

### Bugsnag (non-technical summary — only here)
- The non-technical Bugsnag comment is **produced and posted by `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md`**, not by this skill. Plain language understandable by non-developers, in the two sections that skill renders on every target: *What changed* (Problem / Cause / Result / What I fixed, plus its two conditional fields) and *How to test*, followed by the closing links line. No file paths, line numbers, code snippets, or severity jargon.
- Bugsnag gets **no reduced shape** — it renders the same structure as GitHub and JIRA, only in plain text with no markup at all. Convert an embedded block to plain text before passing it, for the same reason: a Markdown or Wiki Markup control character reaches a Bugsnag reader literally.

---

## After Completion

- Do **not** change the Bugsnag error status (fixed / ignored / snoozed) automatically — marking an error fixed is left to a human after the fix is verified in production.
