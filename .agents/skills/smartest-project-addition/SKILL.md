## Constraints
- Apply `@rules/php/core-standards.md` **only once it is established that the project is a PHP project (PHP stack in `composer.json`) and the proposed addition touches PHP code** — skip it for a non-PHP project or a non-code proposal; do not load the PHP standards when the addition does not touch PHP.
- Recommend exactly one addition
- Do not include alternative proposals in the final answer
- Do not implement code unless explicitly requested

## Use when
- You want the single most valuable next addition to the project
- You want a concrete recommendation, not a list of ideas

## Required approach
- Inspect the current repository and identify the strongest leverage point across architecture, DX, reliability, performance, security, or delivery speed
- Evaluate candidate ideas by:
    - impact
    - implementation complexity
    - risk
    - reversibility
- Select exactly one proposal with the best overall leverage

## Output
Provide:
- a concise proposal statement
- why this is the best next addition now
- expected business and technical benefits
- key risks and mitigations
- smallest safe implementation plan
- test/validation strategy
- rollout and rollback notes

## Done when
- The recommendation is concrete, measurable, and actionable
- The final answer contains exactly one proposal
- The proposal is justified by impact relative to complexity and risk

## Output Humanization
- Use [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) for all skill outputs to keep the text natural and human-friendly.
