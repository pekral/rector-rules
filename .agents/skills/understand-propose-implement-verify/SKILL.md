## Constraints
- Apply `@rules/php/core-standards.md` **only once it is established that the project is a PHP project (PHP stack in `composer.json`) and the change touches PHP code** — skip it for non-PHP work (docs, tooling, infra, config); do not load the PHP standards for a task that does not touch PHP.
- If the current project uses Laravel, also apply `@rules/laravel/laravel.md`, `@rules/laravel/architecture.md`, `@rules/laravel/filament.md`, and `@rules/laravel/livewire.md` (likewise only when the change touches PHP)
- Always follow this order: understand → propose → implement → verify
- Prefer existing project skills over custom solutions; do not duplicate logic already covered by a skill

## Use when
- Solving a task that requires structured thinking and controlled execution
- Coordinating multiple steps or skills

## Execution

### 1. Understand
- Analyze the problem, context, and related resources
- Classify the task (bug, feature, refactor, review, etc.)
- Define a short checklist of goals, constraints, and assumptions

### 2. Propose
- Suggest the smallest safe solution
- Explain why this approach is preferred (impact, risk, trade-offs)
- Select relevant existing skills to execute the plan

### 3. Implement
- Execute the solution using selected skills where applicable
- Keep changes focused and aligned with project conventions
- Add or update tests for changed behavior

### 4. Verify
- Validate the result against requirements
- Run relevant checks/tests for the affected scope
- Ensure no regressions or unintended side effects
- Summarize what was changed, tested, and any remaining risks

## Done when
- The task is fully addressed
- The solution follows the defined loop
- Existing skills were reused where applicable
- Results are validated and clearly summarized

## Output Humanization
- Use [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) for all skill outputs to keep the text natural and human-friendly.
