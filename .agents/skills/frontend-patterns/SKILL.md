## Constraints
- Apply `@rules/laravel/livewire.md` — class in `app/Livewire`, view in `resources/views/livewire`, extend `Livewire\Component`; components are slim entry points; delegate business logic to Actions/Services; inject dependencies via `boot()`, never as method params; Blade stays presentation-only.
- Apply `@rules/laravel/filament.md` — prefer Filament form/table components for admin UIs; custom Blade+Tailwind needs a registered theme.
- Apply `@rules/laravel/architecture.md` — keep query/business logic out of views and components.
- Apply `@rules/sql/optimalize.md` — eager-load to avoid N+1 in loops rendered by Blade.
- Stack is Blade + Livewire + Alpine.js + Filament + Tailwind. No React/Vue/Next — never output `useState`/`useEffect`/`useMemo`/JSX/Framer Motion/React Query.

## Modes

This skill runs in one of two modes, selected by the caller via `MODE` (default `build`):

- **`build` (default)** — full UI work: create and edit Blade views and Livewire components, move state between layers, add `wire:key` and `wire:model` modifiers, and wire up loading / empty / error states. Every section below behaves as written unless it is explicitly flagged for `MODE=cr`.
- **`cr` (read-only lens — invoked by `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md`, `code-review-github`, `code-review-jira`, and `code-review-bugsnag` when the diff touches a frontend surface)** — **never modify a view or a component, never author a test, never stage / commit / push, never run fixers or checkers, and never chain a follow-up review.** Scope the analysis to the lines added or modified by the PR diff and return the findings as markdown only, carrying the reproducer fields the CR folds into its standard Critical / Moderate / Minor buckets.
Every instruction below that would touch a file — compose, extract, move, add, replace, split, or any other such verb — is emitted as a written proposal carrying a concrete Blade / Livewire snippet, never applied to the project.

> **What this lens owns in a CR:** component composition, where state lives (Livewire vs Alpine), render and network cost, form mechanics, and whether the loading / empty / error / offline states exist and behave. It **defers** accessibility semantics to `@skills/frontend-a11y/SKILL.md` and token / theme consistency to `@skills/design-system/SKILL.md`, and never raises a finding those two own. It **defers the decision that a block should become its own component** — an oversized view, an oversized `@foreach` body, a nameable UI concern still inline — to the walk *Livewire / Blade layout splitting* (`@rules/laravel/livewire.md` *Triggers*): this lens judges composition inside a component that already exists, and never raises a finding whose fix is *extract this*.
> It **defers which bundle the view loads** — the entrypoint, the `@vite` directive that pulls it in, the manifest behind it, and how it splits — to `@skills/vite-patterns/SKILL.md` with `MODE=cr`: this lens's render and network cost is what the rendered component costs, never how the bundle behind it is built.
> It **defers what the changed `<head>` promises a crawler** — the canonical, the robots directive, the on-page tags, the JSON-LD payload, and what that head asks the browser to fetch first for LCP — to `@skills/seo/SKILL.md` with `MODE=cr`, and never raises a finding that lens owns.

## Use when
- Composing UI from Blade/Livewire components.
- Deciding where state lives (Livewire vs Alpine).
- Optimizing render/network cost of a Livewire view.
- Building forms with validation.
- Handling loading, empty, error, and offline states.

## Component composition

Compose; do not inherit. Prefer small components with slots over big configurable ones.

```blade
{{-- resources/views/components/card.blade.php (anonymous component) --}}
@props(['variant' => 'default'])
<div {{ $attributes->class(['card', 'card-outlined' => $variant === 'outlined']) }}>
    {{ $slot }}
</div>
```

```blade
<x-card variant="outlined">
    <x-slot:header>Title</x-slot:header>
    Content
</x-card>
```

- **Anonymous components** (view-only, in `resources/views/components`) for pure presentation.
- **Class components** (`app/View/Components`) only when the component needs PHP logic to prepare data.
- **`{{ $attributes }}`** forwards caller classes/attributes — merge, don't overwrite.
- **Named slots** (`<x-slot:header>`) replace prop-drilling content.

### Livewire nesting

A "compound" UI is a parent Livewire component holding child Livewire components. Children are independent; pass data down via props and communicate up via events/listeners — never tight coupling.

```blade
@foreach ($rows as $row)
    <livewire:row-editor :row="$row" :key="$row->id" />
@endforeach
```

Always set `:key` on nested components and loop items so Livewire tracks identity across re-renders.

---

## State placement: Livewire vs Alpine

Put state where it belongs. The wrong choice causes either chattiness or lost server state.

- **Livewire public properties** — server-authoritative data, anything persisted or validated, anything other components react to.
- **Livewire computed properties** (`#[Computed]`) — derived values from properties/DB; cached per request, keeps the view clean.
- **Alpine `x-data`** — purely local UI state that the server never needs: dropdown open/closed, active tab, hover, optimistic toggles.

```blade
{{-- local-only: no server round-trip --}}
<div x-data="{ open: false }">
    <button x-on:click="open = !open">Menu</button>
    <nav x-show="open" x-cloak>…</nav>
</div>
```

```php
// derived server state
#[Computed]
public function total(): int
{
    return $this->items->sum('price');
}
```

Rule of thumb: if toggling it should hit the database or affect validation, it is Livewire; if it is ephemeral chrome, it is Alpine. Bridge the two with `@entangle` only when both sides genuinely need the value.

## Performance

- **`wire:key` in loops** — mandatory; without it Livewire mis-reconciles DOM and loses focus/state.
- **Tune `wire:model`** — default is deferred (syncs on action). Use `.live` only when the server must react to every keystroke; prefer `.blur` or `.debounce.500ms` for inputs to cut requests.

```blade
<input type="search" wire:model.live.debounce.400ms="search">
```

- **Lazy / deferred loading** — render expensive components after first paint with `<livewire:report lazy />`, or `#[Lazy]` on the class, to keep the initial response fast.
- **Pagination** — use `WithPagination`; never load full tables into a property.
- **Avoid N+1 in views** — eager-load relations in the query before passing to Blade; cross-reference `@rules/sql/optimalize.md`. A relation accessed inside a `@foreach` without eager loading fires one query per row.

```php
$this->orders = Order::with('customer')->latest()->paginate(20);
```

- **Asset stacks** — register component CSS/JS once with `@once` + `@push('scripts')` so repeated components don't duplicate output.

---

## Forms

Prefer Livewire form objects to keep components slim and validation reusable.

```php
// app/Livewire/Forms/MarketForm.php
class MarketForm extends Form
{
    #[Validate('required|string|max:200')]
    public string $name = '';

    #[Validate('required|string')]
    public string $description = '';
}
```

```php
// component
public MarketForm $form;

public function save(CreateMarket $action): void   // Action injected via boot() or method DI
{
    $this->validate();
    $action->handle($this->form->toArray());
    $this->reset('form');
}
```

- **Real-time validation** — `wire:model.blur` plus an `updated()` hook (or per-field `$this->validateOnly($field)`) validates as the user leaves each field without validating the whole form on every key.
- Keep `messages()`/`attributes()` free of identity-revealing detail per `@rules/security/frontend.md`.
- For admin CRUD, prefer Filament forms over hand-built ones.

---

## Loading, empty, error, offline states

Design all four states, not just the happy path.

```blade
{{-- loading --}}
<button wire:click="save" wire:loading.attr="disabled" wire:target="save">
    <span wire:loading.remove wire:target="save">Save</span>
    <span wire:loading wire:target="save">Saving…</span>
</button>

{{-- empty --}}
@forelse ($orders as $order)
    <livewire:order-row :order="$order" :key="$order->id" />
@empty
    <x-empty-state title="No orders yet" />
@endforelse

{{-- offline --}}
<div wire:offline class="banner-warning">You are offline — changes will retry.</div>
```

- **Errors** — surface failures with `session()->flash()` + a `role="alert"` region, or a validation message; never swallow exceptions in the component. Delegate the actual work to an Action that can throw, and catch only to present a safe message.
- **Skeletons** — show `wire:loading` placeholders for lazy/deferred components so layout doesn't jump.

---

## Progressive enhancement with Alpine

Render meaningful HTML server-side first; layer Alpine for interactivity so the page is useful before JS runs and degrades gracefully if it doesn't.

```blade
<details x-data x-bind:open="open">  {{-- works without JS via native <details>; Alpine enhances --}}
    <summary>Filters</summary>
    …
</details>
```

Keep Alpine logic small and inline; if it grows beyond a few expressions, move the state into a Livewire component.

---

## Done when
- Components are composed from slots/attributes; no oversized configurable mega-components.
- State sits on the correct layer (Livewire for server/validated, Alpine for local chrome).
- Every loop and nested component has a stable `wire:key`/`:key`.
- `wire:model` strategy minimizes requests; no `.live` where `.blur`/`.debounce` suffices.
- Lists eager-load relations — no N+1 in Blade.
- Forms use form objects + validation; admin CRUD reuses Filament.
- Loading, empty, error, and offline states are all handled.
- No React/Vue artifacts; business logic stays in Actions/Services, not the component.
