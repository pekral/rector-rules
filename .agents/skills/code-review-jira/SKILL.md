## Constraints
- Apply the shared CR tracker-wrapper contract in `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` — Constraints, Load Context gates, Run Reviews, Publish Results, and Output Rules all live there and are not restated here. This file carries only what a JIRA-sourced review decides for itself.
- Apply @rules/jira/general.md
- Publishing is limited to PR / linked-issue comments via `gh` and to JIRA ticket comments via `acli`.
- Apply @rules/reports/general.md *A JIRA comment is written for a non-technical reader* — the banned-content list, its two exceptions, and the 3 000-character cap bind every comment this skill puts on a JIRA ticket, the embedded blocks included. The publisher converts the constrained template source to ADF and applies it through `--body-adf`.
- **The split is the point of this wrapper: technical findings go to the GitHub pull request, and the JIRA ticket receives the non-technical summary alone.** Never publish severity labels, finding counts, code references, a head SHA, a diff fingerprint, a gate result, a CI status, or a coverage figure to JIRA. None of it is lost — the GitHub PR comment carries it, and that is the comment `@skills/merge-github-pr/SKILL.md` reads.

## Scope
Perform code review for JIRA issues by analyzing related pull requests and publishing results to:
- GitHub (technical findings)
- JIRA (human-readable summary)

---

## Execution

### 1. Load Context
- Load JIRA context by running `skills/code-review-jira/scripts/load-issue.sh <KEY|URL>`. The script accepts a bare key (`ACME-1234`), a `/browse/<KEY>` URL, or any URL containing `?selectedIssue=<KEY>`. Read issue header, description, comments, attachments, subtasks, issue links, custom fields, `devSummary`, and `pullRequests` off the resulting JSON document.
- The context-brief and comment-array helpers are `skills/code-review-jira/scripts/gather-issue-context.sh <KEY|URL>` and `skills/code-review-jira/scripts/parse-comments.sh <KEY|URL>`. The brief renders the issue plus its comments, attachments, recursively-loaded linked issues, and an inventory of external URLs. `acli` cannot download attachments, so their content is read with your own tools.
- Prefer the JIRA MCP fallback for the data the scripts cannot cover: changelog (`expand=changelog`), available next transitions, and friendly custom-field names (`expand=names`).
- Identify all open PRs linked to the issue from the script's `pullRequests` array.
- **Repository ownership** — run the hard gate (`@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Repository ownership*) **per linked PR, after the `pullRequests` array is known and before that PR is checked out**. A JIRA project can carry links to PRs across several repositories, so this is where a cross-repo review silently starts — and it is why this wrapper skips a mismatching PR and continues with the rest instead of stopping the run.

#### Issue Context Analysis
The assignment is the **JIRA issue**. Fetch it complete — description, all comments, and all attachments (screenshots, files, embedded data) — and run the four analysis steps in `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Issue Context Analysis* against it.

#### Incremental review scope — where the round history lives
The baseline still resolves from the **GitHub PR's** CR comments (`@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Incremental review scope*) — JIRA carries no reviewed revision. The round markers this wrapper reads as a pointer to that history are the `kolo N` / `round N` markers in the **JIRA description and comments**, and they are resolved **per linked PR**: each PR keeps its own baseline, so a ticket linking several PRs never crosses one PR's revision into another's delta.

### 2. Pre-checks
- `statusCheckRollup[]` for the CI check map comes off the GitHub PR JSON, loaded via `skills/code-review-github/scripts/load-issue.sh <PR-URL>` if it is not already loaded.

### 3. Run Reviews
Run the always-run set, the conditional set, and the reuse-first gate exactly as `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *3. Run Reviews* defines them, for **each** linked PR. Two JIRA-specific riders apply:

- Convert the `## Assignment Compliance` block `@skills/assignment-compliance-check/SKILL.md` returns to the supported JIRA intermediate source before passing it to `pr-summary`, and keep the GitHub-Markdown original for the linked-GitHub-issue mirror. The JIRA helper converts that source to ADF. The block travels on every run with a linked ticket, its affirmative verdict included — a JIRA comment that stays silent when every criterion is met tells the ticket owner nothing (`@rules/code-review/general.md` *Two-Part CR Output* → *The tracker comment carries the same verdict — in all three cases*).
- Every blocking documentation request from the Third-Party API & Service Analysis also becomes a plain-language one-liner in the JIRA *Clarifying questions* block below, so whichever tracker the answerer reads carries the ask.

### 4. Publish Results

#### JIRA (consolidated non-technical comment — one comment per issue, updated in place)
- Delegate the JIRA comment to `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md`: invoke it with the **JIRA** tracker target so it renders `@skills/pr-summary/templates/pr-summary-jira.md` as the intermediate source and publishes real ADF via `skills/code-review-jira/scripts/upsert-comment.sh` (JIRA MCP server fallback on exit code 2/3). No direct JIRA comment write may bypass the helper.
- The JIRA comment carries the shape `pr-summary` renders for **this** target — a status sentence, `Acceptance criteria`, `How to test`, `What changed`, then the closing links line — as rendered ADF (`@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md` *The JIRA shape*). There is **no reduced JIRA shape**: this is not a cut-down GitHub comment but its own order, written for the person who owns the ticket, who needs the verdict before anything else. State this rather than assuming it, because JIRA did receive a cut-down shape until this contract changed.
- Pass both blocks together in one invocation — *Clarifying questions* (conditional: only when a question survives the gate below) and *Assignment Compliance* (always, on every run with a linked ticket). On JIRA `pr-summary` renders the compliance verdict into the `Acceptance criteria` section rather than appending it, and the `{embedded_blocks}` slot carries the clarifying questions alone; the verdict still reaches the reader exactly once, and now first. Still no severity counts and no file paths: the JIRA comment stays non-technical.
- Test-parameter gating lives inside the **first step of `How to test`**, which enables the toggle before the tester proceeds. The toggle name and its value are strings the tester types, so they are the rule's verbatim-string exception rather than technical detail.
- **Clarifying questions block (conditional).** While running the sub-reviews, collect every **genuine open question** the reviewer needs answered before the work can be accepted — an ambiguity in the assignment that the issue description, comments, and code could not resolve (a missing acceptance criterion, an undefined edge case, a value the assignment never specified, a contradiction between the ticket and a comment). Then put every candidate through the **severity gate** and the **already-answered walk** below, in that order, and assemble the block only from what survives both. When at least one question survives, assemble a `h2.
Clarifying questions` block in the supported JIRA intermediate source (one `*` bullet per question, each a single plain-language sentence) and pass it as an embedded block to `pr-summary` so it renders after `How to test`. When none survives, pass nothing — never emit an empty "no questions" block, and never a "previously answered" note. Do not invent questions to fill the section; ask only what genuinely blocks acceptance. **Every blocking documentation request** produced by the Third-Party API & Service Analysis step 7 is such a question and must appear here as one bullet, phrased so a non-developer can forward it:
the vendor / service name, the version in use (or that it could not be determined), and the ask for a documentation link covering the reviewed operations. Keep the endpoint / SDK-method list itself on the GitHub PR comment — JIRA carries no technical detail per the constraint above.
- **Severity gate and already-answered walk (issue #208).** Emit only **Critical** questions (without the answer the change cannot be accepted) and **Moderate** ones (the change ships either way, but the answer decides whether the implemented behaviour is the intended one); **Minor** questions are dropped, never asked. Then walk every comment step 1 already loaded and drop each question the tracker has already answered **and** the diff already implements. Severity is never rendered — the block carries plain sentences in Critical-before-Moderate order. The full gate, the sources walked, the answered-but-not-implemented case, and the ambiguous-answer rule live in `references/clarifying-questions.md`.
- **ADF source conversion.** Convert an embedded Markdown block to the supported source per @rules/jira/general.md (`## ` → `h2. `, `**bold**` → `*bold*`, `` `code` `` → `{{code}}`, `- ` → `* `, Markdown link `[label]` + `(url)` → `[label|url]`) before passing it. Verify the source contains no leaked Markdown. The canonical helper performs the only conversion to ADF and the only `acli` write; never post the source directly.

#### Linked GitHub issues (consolidated mirror — one comment per issue, updated in place)
- The JIRA-side summary is the **primary** tracker comment; the linked-GitHub-issue comment is a courtesy mirror so reviewers reading the GitHub issue see the same report without opening JIRA. Both come from `pr-summary` and carry the same facts, but **not the same shape**: the mirror renders the GitHub structure (*What changed*, *How to test*, and the *Assignment Compliance* block through `{embedded_blocks}`), while the ticket renders the JIRA one (*Acceptance criteria*, *How to test*, *What changed*, with the verdict inside the first section).
  Do not copy one body onto the other target — render each from its own template, or the mirror publishes a shape that target's contract does not define. Publish it per `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Linked GitHub issues*, passing the GitHub-Markdown version of any embedded block.
- If `closingIssues[]` is empty, note `no linked GitHub issue — mirror skipped` in the PR comment summary line.

## Output Rules

### GitHub (technical report — only here)

Apply `@skills/code-review-github/references/cr-wrapper-contract.md` *Output Rules — GitHub PR comment*, and use the template defined in `templates/github-output.md`. The JIRA-specific slots it leaves open:

- The header block's tracker-mirror field is `Linked-tracker mirror`.
- The summary line's tracker-mirror status is `posted JIRA summary on <KEY> (+ mirrored to GitHub issue #N)`, `JIRA only — no linked GitHub issue`, or `failed: <reason>`.

### JIRA (non-technical summary — only here)
- The non-technical JIRA comment is **produced and posted by `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md`**, not by this skill. Do not author or embed a custom template here.
- It carries no severity counts, no file paths, no line numbers, no code snippets — plain language understandable by non-developers, per @rules/reports/general.md *A JIRA comment is written for a non-technical reader*. Its sections are `Acceptance criteria`, `How to test`, and `What changed`, under one status sentence; `pr-summary` owns all three, and this skill neither authors nor reorders them.
- The intermediate source constructs (`h2.` / `h3.` headings, `*bold*`, `_italic_`, `{{inline}}`, `{code:php} ... {code}`, `*` / `#` bullets, `[label|url]`, `{quote}`) come from `@skills/pr-summary/templates/pr-summary-jira.md`. The helper converts them to ADF nodes and marks per @rules/jira/general.md.

### The split, verified per run

Before the run ends, confirm both halves actually landed where they belong. The split is a property of what was published, not of what was intended.

1. The **GitHub PR comment** carries the technical report — findings, severities, counts, the reviewed revision, the diff fingerprint, coverage, and the quality-gate result.
2. The **JIRA comment** carries the non-technical summary alone, and nothing on the banned list survives in it. Walk the rendered body against that list before the publish; `agents/april.md` runs the same walk when it is the publisher.

A path that would put technical content on the ticket is a defect in that path, never an exception to grant here. Two such paths were closed with this contract: the merge-readiness TL;DR, which published the head SHA, the diff fingerprint, and the gate result to whichever tracker the source was (`@skills/verify-merge-readiness/SKILL.md`), and a standalone `leonardo` review on a JIRA source, which published its severity-sorted findings to the ticket instead of to the pull request (`agents/leonardo.md`).
