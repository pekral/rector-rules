## Constraints
- Apply `@rules/laravel/laravel.md` — use the framework's facades (`Cache`, `RateLimiter`, `Redis`), not a raw client.
- Apply `@rules/laravel/queue-debouncing.md` for queue/job coalescing concerns when Redis backs the queue.
- Cross-link `@rules/sql/optimalize.md` (DB-level caching) — Redis caching sits in front of the query tuning that rule owns; cache the result, do not paper over an unindexed query.
- `final` classes, `declare(strict_types=1)`, Pest tests (use the `array` cache driver in tests unless asserting Redis-specific behavior).
- Always set a TTL. Keys without expiry accumulate and cause memory pressure.

## Modes

This skill runs in one of two modes, selected by the caller via `MODE` (default `design`):

- **`design` (default)** — full Redis work: write caching code, add locks and rate limiters, set key and TTL conventions, and change cache, queue, session, or eviction configuration. Every section below behaves as written unless it is explicitly flagged for `MODE=cr`.
- **`cr` (read-only lens — invoked by `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md`, `code-review-github`, `code-review-jira`, and `code-review-bugsnag` when the diff touches a cache, lock, or rate-limit surface)** — **never modify code, never author a test, never stage / commit / push, never run fixers or checkers, and never chain a follow-up review.** Scope the analysis to the lines added or modified by the PR diff and return the findings as markdown only, carrying the reproducer fields the CR folds into its standard Critical / Moderate / Minor buckets.
Every instruction below that would touch a file or a server — set, add, guard, configure, publish, or any other such verb — is emitted as a written proposal carrying a concrete PHP or configuration snippet, never applied to the project.

> **What this lens owns in a CR:** how a cache, lock, or rate-limit call behaves — TTL presence and length, key naming and collision, stampede protection on a cold or expired rebuild, lock acquisition / ownership / release, rate-limit construction, eviction policy against the store's role, and `KEYS *` or per-command loops where `SCAN` or a pipeline belongs. It **defers the shape of the cached value** — an Eloquent model, a DTO, a Collection of models, or any other object stored where raw data belongs — to `@rules/code-review/core-analysis.md` *Object caching (issue #683)*, and never raises a finding that bullet owns.
> The lens runs whatever cache store the project configures. **Never raise a finding whose only fix is to adopt Redis**, or a Redis-only feature such as cache tags, `Redis::throttle`, `Redis::funnel`, or a server eviction policy: the store is a project decision, not a defect on the diff.

## Use when
- Adding caching, rate limiting, distributed coordination, or pub/sub to a Laravel app.
- Choosing a cache strategy, protecting a cold cache from stampede, or designing key/TTL conventions.
- Configuring Redis as the session, cache, or queue store.

Use Laravel facades throughout. Reach for raw `Redis::command(...)` only for structures the Cache abstraction does not expose (sorted sets, streams).

## Caching Strategies

### Cache-Aside (default for read-heavy data)

```php
$product = Cache::remember("product:{$id}", now()->addMinutes(10), fn () =>
    Product::findOrFail($id),
);
```

`remember()` is read-through cache-aside: returns the cached value or runs the closure, stores it, and returns it. Use `rememberForever()` only with an explicit invalidation path.

### Write-Through (consistency required)

```php
$product->update($data);
Cache::put("product:{$product->id}", $product->fresh(), now()->addMinutes(10));
// Or simply invalidate so the next read repopulates:
Cache::forget("product:{$product->id}");
```

Invalidate (forget) rather than rewrite when the cached shape may differ from the model.

### Cache Tags (grouped invalidation)

```php
Cache::tags(['products', "category:{$categoryId}"])
    ->remember("product:{$id}", now()->addMinutes(10), fn () => Product::findOrFail($id));

Cache::tags(["category:{$categoryId}"])->flush(); // drop the whole group at once
```

Tags require the `redis` (or `memcached`) store — not `file`/`database`. They add key overhead; use for genuine groups, not single keys.

## Stampede Protection

A cold/expired hot key can trigger many concurrent rebuilds (thundering herd). Guard the rebuild with an atomic lock so only one worker recomputes.

```php
public function getReport(string $key): array
{
    return Cache::get($key) ?? Cache::lock("rebuild:{$key}", seconds: 10)->block(5, function () use ($key) {
        // Re-check inside the lock — another worker may have just populated it.
        return Cache::get($key) ?? tap($this->computeReport(), fn ($v) =>
            Cache::put($key, $v, now()->addMinutes(15)),
        );
    });
}
```

- `Cache::lock()` is an atomic `SET NX PX` lock; `block(5, ...)` waits up to 5s to acquire.
- Alternative for very hot keys: stale-while-revalidate — serve the slightly stale value while one worker refreshes in the background, avoiding any blocking.

## Distributed Locks

Coordinate exclusive access across workers/requests.

```php
$lock = Cache::lock('payment:'.$orderId, seconds: 30);
if ($lock->get()) {
    try {
        $this->processPayment($orderId);
    } finally {
        $lock->release(); // always release in finally
    }
}
```

- The TTL must exceed the expected work; on crash the lock auto-expires so it never wedges permanently.
- Only the owner may release — Laravel tracks the owner token, so `release()` is safe. Use `forceRelease()` only deliberately.
- For bounded concurrency (N parallel, not 1), use `Redis::funnel('job')->limit(3)->then(fn () => ...)`.

## Rate Limiting

Prefer the framework limiter over hand-rolled counters.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

$executed = RateLimiter::attempt("send:{$user->id}", maxAttempts: 5, function (): void {
    $this->sendMessage();
}, decaySeconds: 60);

if (! $executed) {
    abort(429); // or RateLimiter::availableIn($key) for retry hint
}
```

- HTTP routes: define a named limiter (`RateLimiter::for('api', fn ($r) => Limit::perMinute(60)->by($r->user()?->id ?: $r->ip()))`) and apply `throttle:api` middleware.
- For high-throughput throttling, `Redis::throttle('key')->allow(60)->every(60)->then($ok, $tooMany)` runs the check in a single atomic Redis call.

## Key Naming & TTL Discipline

```
{app}:{resource}:{id}            myapp:product:123
{app}:{resource}:{id}:{field}    myapp:order:456:status
{app}:{resource}:{date}          myapp:stats:pageviews:2026-06-14
```

| Data | Suggested TTL |
|------|---------------|
| API/query response cache | 5–15 min |
| User session | 24h |
| Rate-limit window | = window size |
| Short-lived token | 5–10 min |
| Reference/static data | 1h–1 week |

- Use Laravel's `cache.prefix` for the app namespace; do not hand-prefix every key.
- Never run `KEYS *` in production (O(N), blocks the server) — use `SCAN` via `Redis::scan()`.

## Eviction Policy

Set `maxmemory` + `maxmemory-policy` in `redis.conf` per role:

| Policy | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| `allkeys-lru` | General cache (evict least-recently-used) |
| `volatile-lru` | Mixed cache + must-keep data (only evict keys with TTL) |
| `allkeys-lfu` | Skewed access (hot keys survive) |
| `noeviction` | Queue / session store — errors instead of dropping data |

Critical: do **not** point a Redis queue/session connection at an `allkeys-lru` instance — it will silently evict jobs/sessions. Separate the cache instance/DB from the queue instance.

## Pub/Sub

Fire-and-forget broadcast; no delivery guarantee or replay.

```php
Redis::publish('orders', json_encode(['id' => $order->id]));

// Long-running listener (artisan command):
Redis::subscribe(['orders'], function (string $message): void {
    $this->handle(json_decode($message, true));
});
```

If you need durability, consumer groups, or replay, use the Laravel queue (below) or Redis Streams via `Redis::command('XADD', ...)` — Pub/Sub drops messages for absent subscribers.

## Pipelines & Transactions

Batch many commands in one round trip; use a transaction when they must apply atomically.

```php
Redis::pipeline(function ($pipe) use ($ids): void {
    foreach ($ids as $id) {
        $pipe->del("product:{$id}");
    }
}); // one round trip, NOT atomic

Redis::transaction(function ($tx) use ($key): void {
    $tx->incr($key);
    $tx->expire($key, 60);
}); // MULTI/EXEC — all-or-nothing
```

Pipelines cut latency for bulk ops; transactions add atomicity. Do not loop single commands when a pipeline fits.

## Queues, Sessions & Stores

- **Queues:** set `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis`. Run **Laravel Horizon** for Redis queues — it gives supervisor config, metrics, and a dashboard. For coalescing bursty jobs see `@rules/laravel/queue-debouncing.md`.
- **Sessions / cache:** `SESSION_DRIVER=redis`, `CACHE_STORE=redis`. Keep sessions/queue on a `noeviction` instance and cache on an `allkeys-lru` instance (or distinct DB indexes) so cache eviction never drops a session or job.
- Size the predis/phpredis pool and set `socket_timeout` / `read_timeout` so a stalled Redis fails fast instead of hanging requests.

## Done when
- Every key has an intentional TTL and follows the naming convention.
- Hot/cold cache rebuilds are stampede-protected with `Cache::lock`.
- Cache and queue/session use separate instances or DBs with matching eviction policies.
- Rate limiting uses `RateLimiter` / `Redis::throttle`, not ad-hoc counters.
- Pest tests cover cache hit/miss and lock paths; no `KEYS *` in production code.
