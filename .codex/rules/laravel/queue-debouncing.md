# Laravel Queue Debouncing

## Core Principle
- Debounce only work where the latest state safely replaces previous triggers.
- Debounce belongs to a replaceable outcome, not to a generic entity.
- A debounce key must describe what result may be safely replaced, not only which model changed.

Good debounce keys describe the replaceable outcome:

```text
read-model:order:123
crm-sync:user:42
search-index:post:99
usage-summary:account:7
preview-render:document:15
```

Bad debounce keys are too generic and collapse unrelated business events:

```text
order:123
user:42
account:7
project:15
```

## Allowed Use Cases
Debouncing is allowed only for convergent work where intermediate states may be skipped safely:

- Search index rebuilds
- Cache refreshes
- Read model rebuilds
- CRM/profile snapshot syncs
- Preview/render regeneration
- Aggregate/statistical summary recalculation
- Expensive derived data refreshes

## Forbidden Use Cases
Never debounce meaningful business events where each occurrence has its own meaning. Do not debounce:

- Payments
- Refunds
- Password changes
- Security alerts
- Audit logs
- Webhook event recording
- Fulfillment or shipment transitions
- User-visible notifications expected immediately
- Anything where order, timing, or exact occurrence matters

## Split Mixed-Urgency Workflows
Split urgent and replaceable work into separate jobs. Urgent jobs must stay immediate and idempotent; convergent jobs may be debounced.

Bad — one generic sync job hides both urgent and convergent side effects:

```php
SyncOrder::dispatch($order->id);
```

Good — explicit jobs with clear business meaning:

```php
ProcessCapturedPayment::dispatch($payment->id, $order->id);

RefreshOrderReadModel::dispatch($order->id);
SyncOrderSnapshotToCrm::dispatch($order->id);
```

## Idempotency Is Still Required
Debounce does not replace idempotency.

- Debounce answers: should we avoid running this repeated work too many times?
- Idempotency answers: is the result still correct if this job runs more than once?

Urgent jobs must not rely on debounce for safety — make them idempotent and dispatch them immediately.

## Debounced Jobs Must Load Fresh State
Pass identifiers into debounced jobs and load the latest state inside `handle()`. Never rely on serialized model snapshots — they may be stale by the time the debounce window closes.

Good:

```php
final readonly class SyncUserSnapshotToCrm implements ShouldQueue
{
    public function __construct(
        private int $userId,
    ) {
    }

    public function debounceKey(): string
    {
        return "crm-sync:user:{$this->userId}";
    }

    public function debounceFor(): int
    {
        return 5;
    }

    public function handle(UserRepository $users, CrmSyncService $crm): void
    {
        $user = $users->findOrFail($this->userId);

        $crm->syncUserSnapshot($user);
    }
}
```

Bad — passing a serialized model freezes state at dispatch time:

```php
public function __construct(
    private User $user,
) {
}
```

## Review Checklist
Reviewers must verify:

- The job represents replaceable/convergent work.
- The debounce key describes the replaceable outcome.
- The debounce key is not only a generic model/entity key.
- No payment, refund, security, audit, password, webhook, shipment, or notification event can be suppressed.
- Mixed urgency has been split into separate jobs.
- Urgent jobs are idempotent instead of debounced.
- The job loads fresh state inside `handle()`.
- Tests verify urgent and debounced side effects are dispatched separately.

## Testing Requirements
Add tests that verify urgent and convergent jobs are dispatched separately and that debounce keys describe the replaceable outcome.

```php
it('dispatches payment processing separately from read model refresh', function (): void {
    Queue::fake();

    $order = Order::factory()->create();
    $payment = Payment::factory()->for($order)->create();

    app(CapturePaymentAction::class)($payment->id);

    Queue::assertPushed(ProcessCapturedPayment::class);
    Queue::assertPushed(RefreshOrderReadModel::class);
});
```

```php
it('uses a specific debounce key for order read model refresh', function (): void {
    $job = new RefreshOrderReadModel(orderId: 123);

    expect($job->debounceKey())->toBe('read-model:order:123');
});
```

## Architecture Rules
- Controllers, commands, listeners, jobs, and Livewire components must not decide debounce strategy ad hoc.
- Debounce strategy belongs near the job class or the Action that dispatches it.
- Do not hide multiple unrelated side effects inside one generic sync job.
- Prefer small, explicit jobs with clear business meaning.
- Use Actions for orchestration and dispatch jobs from there when the workflow contains multiple side effects.

## Red Flags
Reject or flag patterns where the debounce key is generic or where one job hides unrelated side effects:

```php
debounceKey(): string
{
    return "order:{$this->orderId}";
}
```

```php
debounceKey(): string
{
    return "user:{$this->userId}";
}
```

```php
debounceKey(): string
{
    return static::class.':'.$this->modelId;
}
```

```php
SyncOrder::dispatch($order->id);
SyncUser::dispatch($user->id);
ProcessEverythingLater::dispatch($model->id);
```

## Safe Rule Of Thumb
Ask:

```text
If two matching events happen 500 ms apart, is it correct that one of them disappears?
```

If the answer is not clearly yes, do not debounce it. Use idempotency, unique jobs, locks, transactions, or separate queues instead.
