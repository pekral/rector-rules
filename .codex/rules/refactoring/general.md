description: Shared definition of refactoring (legacy → modern architecture). Applies to refactoring skills and code review whenever refactoring is in scope.

## What Refactoring Is
- Refactoring is a **behavior-preserving change of code structure**.
- The application keeps doing the same thing; only how it does it changes.
- Goals: readability, structure, and readiness for further development.
- Refactoring is **technical debt reduction**, not a feature.

## Symptoms of Legacy Code
- Large methods (e.g. controllers doing everything).
- Mixed validation, business logic, and persistence in one place.
- Code duplication.
- Poor testability.
- Hidden bugs and race conditions.

## What Refactoring Brings
- Faster delivery of new features.
- Fewer bugs and regressions.
- Better readability.
- Easier onboarding.
- The ability to scale both the application and the team.

## Core Rule
- **Never** do a big-bang rewrite.
- **Always** migrate incrementally, one piece at a time.

## Recommended Process
1. **Stabilize** — add at least smoke tests, fix critical bugs first.
2. **Identify entry points** — start at controllers, jobs, commands, listeners, Livewire components.
3. **Introduce the Action pattern** — keep entry points thin; delegate orchestration to Actions.
4. **Split responsibilities** — Action (orchestration), Service (business logic), Repository (read), ModelManager (write).
5. **Modernize code**:
    - raw arrays → DTOs (e.g. Spatie Laravel Data)
    - static helpers → dependency injection
    - fat models → service layer
    - inline validation → Data Validators / FormRequests
6. **Remove duplication** — apply DRY pragmatically, not dogmatically.
7. **Address concurrency** — DB transactions, `lockForUpdate`, atomic operations instead of read-modify-write on shared state.
8. **Split oversized HTML / Blade layouts** — when the refactor touches a Livewire / Blade view, analyze its HTML as a tree of UI concerns and split it into the smallest set of reusable Livewire and Blade components per `@rules/laravel/livewire.md` *HTML / Blade Layout Splitting*. Treat the layout split as a structural refactor: the **Test Coverage Contract** below applies in spirit — every rendered branch of the touched view must be exercised by a Livewire / Blade feature test that stays green through the refactor commit unchanged, since PHP `--coverage-clover` does not measure `.blade.php` line-by-line. See the rule's *Process for splitting an existing view* step 6 for the binding wording.

## When to Refactor
- Changes are slow and painful.
- The code is unreadable.
- The team is afraid to touch it.
- The same bugs keep coming back.

## When Not to Refactor
- Just to make the code "look nice".
- Without a business reason.

## Reality Check
- Refactoring does not deliver immediate business value.
- Without it, however:
    - delivery slows down,
    - technical debt grows,
    - error rate increases.
- Refactoring is an investment in future delivery speed and system stability.

## Test Coverage Contract (mandatory — issue #493)

Refactoring is behavior-preserving by definition, so behavior preservation must be **proven** by a test suite that exists **before** the structural change lands. Every refactor must respect the following three-step contract:

1. **Before the refactor commit — verify 100% coverage of the target lines.** Verify coverage of the *current* code that is about to be refactored, using the project's available coverage tooling scoped to those files (see `@rules/php/core-standards.md` Testing section). Every line, branch, and condition the refactor will touch must already be exercised by tests. If coverage is below 100% on those lines, **stop and write the missing tests first**.
2. **Add missing tests in a dedicated commit before the refactor commit.** The new tests live in their own commit using the `test(scope): cover <area> before refactor` form per `@rules/git/general.md` Allowed Types. Never mix new test code with the refactor change in the same commit — the separation is what makes the safety net auditable. **Authoring guidance only; no longer verified by review** — see *What the review no longer verifies* below.
3. **The refactor commit must not modify pre-existing tests.** Once the safety net is in place, the refactor commit changes structure only. Renaming, restructuring, or rewriting tests that existed before the refactor invalidates the proof that behavior was preserved. The only test changes allowed in the refactor commit are those forced by mechanical renames the refactor itself introduces (e.g. moving a class to a new namespace), and even those must be flagged in the commit body. New tests that *cover newly introduced code paths in the refactor* belong in yet another commit after the refactor — not in the refactor commit and not in the pre-refactor coverage commit. **Authoring guidance only; no longer verified by review** — see *What the review no longer verifies* below.
4. **After the refactor commit — re-verify coverage of the changed lines is still 100%.** Run the project's coverage tooling again, scoped to the refactored files, and confirm every line, branch, and condition the refactor touched is still exercised. The pre-existing assertions must pass unchanged *and* coverage must not have regressed. If a refactored line is no longer covered, the refactor introduced an untested path (typically dead code or a new branch) — fix it before finishing, do not paper over it by editing the pre-refactor tests. This proactive re-verification is part of the apply step, not only a code-review check.

### What the review no longer verifies — and what that costs

The code review stopped walking commit history (`@rules/git/general.md` *The three bullets below are authoring guidance, not review criteria*). Steps 2 and 3 above are commit-history claims — a dedicated test commit exists **before** the refactor commit, and the refactor commit touches **no** pre-existing test file — so nothing verifies them any more. They stay in this contract because they are still how a refactor should be authored; they are no longer a gate.

**What is lost, stated rather than hidden: the proof that behaviour was preserved across the refactor.** That proof was never the coverage number. It was the ordering — tests written against the *old* structure, passing unchanged after the new one, with no opportunity to quietly adjust an assertion that the refactor broke. A refactor that rewrites a test in the same commit and reports 100% coverage now passes review, and the review cannot tell it apart from one that preserved behaviour. Only the author's own discipline stands between the two.

Steps 1 and 4 are unaffected. Both read the project's coverage tooling, not the git log, so the review still enforces 100% coverage of every refactored line, branch, and condition — before and after — as a **Critical** finding.

Code review must reject any refactor PR that violates the coverage half of this contract — see the **Code Review Application** section below for the enforcement rules.

## Code Review Application
- Treat this definition as authoritative when reviewing or proposing refactoring.
- Flag big-bang rewrites and mixed-responsibility entry points as findings.
- Prefer incremental migration over wholesale rewrites in suggested fixes.
- **Enforce the coverage half of the Test Coverage Contract above on every refactor PR.** Verify with the project's available coverage tooling, scoped to the changed files, that every refactored line, branch, and condition reports 100% coverage. Sub-100% coverage on the changed lines is a **Critical** finding.
- **Do not check (a) that a dedicated test commit precedes the refactor commit or (b) that the refactor commit modifies no pre-existing test file.** Both read the PR's commit history, which the review no longer walks. They were **Critical** findings and now raise nothing; *What the review no longer verifies* above states what that costs.
- For Laravel projects, combine this rule with `@rules/laravel/architecture.md` (Action pattern, Repositories, ModelManagers, Data Validators, DTOs).
