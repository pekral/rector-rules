description: Language rule for reports published to issue trackers (GitHub, JIRA, Bugsnag)

## Tracker-Published Reports — Language

Every report a skill publishes to an issue tracker **must be written in the same language as the source assignment**, and **must never mix that language with another natural language inside the same comment**. When the GitHub issue / JIRA ticket / Bugsnag-linked issue description is in Czech, the published report is fully in Czech; when it is in English, the report is fully in English. Pick the assignment language and stay in it for every prose sentence of the comment — no parenthetical bilingual hints, no half-translated headings, no English boilerplate dropped into a Czech body.

The rule applies to every tracker target and every tracker output:

- non-technical PR / issue / JIRA summaries (`pr-summary`, `assignment-compliance-check`, `tester-cookbook`)
- security-review and security-threat-analysis reports surfaced on the linked issue or non-technical channel
- analyze-problem / resolve-issue reports surfaced on the tracker
- process-code-review mirrored issue summaries
- any other comment posted on a tracker by a skill

### Exception — technical CR findings on the GitHub PR

One narrowly scoped exception: **the technical code-review comment posted on a GitHub pull request stays in canonical English**, regardless of the assignment language. Specifically:

- `@skills/code-review-github/SKILL.md` PR comments (full CR template — Status, Counts, Findings, Refactoring, Coverage, Summary line)
- `@skills/code-review-jira/SKILL.md` GitHub-side PR comments (the technical findings half of its split publish)
- `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md` review markdown — produced for the wrappers above and never published directly, but the output is shaped for the exception channel and therefore stays English at source
- `@skills/process-code-review/SKILL.md` reply comments on the PR (resolved-items follow-up)
- `@skills/security-review/SKILL.md` audit findings when they are folded into the GitHub PR comment
- `@skills/security-threat-analysis/SKILL.md` remediation reports when posted as a PR comment
- `@skills/resolve-issue/SKILL.md` final technical report posted on the PR (code-review / security-review summary block) — same channel as the CR wrappers above

These seven stay in English because they (a) are machine-parsed by `@skills/process-code-review/SKILL.md` for reproducer extraction; (b) carry severity labels (*Critical / Moderate / Minor* / *High / Low*), structured field labels (*Location*, *Rule*, *Impact*, *Faulty Example*, *Expected Behavior*, *Test Hint*, *Suggested Fix*), and rule references that already exist in English elsewhere in the codebase; (c) live next to code identifiers, error messages, and discussion threads from non-Czech contributors. Translating them creates parsing breakage and cross-language drift without helping the reader.

The exception does **not** extend to:

- the non-technical mirror published on the linked GitHub issue (`closingIssues[]`) — that follows the assignment language
- the JIRA-side comment from `code-review-jira` (delegated to `pr-summary`) — that follows the assignment language
- the assignment-compliance comment from `assignment-compliance-check` — that follows the assignment language
- the `pr-summary` comment, regardless of where it is posted — that follows the assignment language. Every target (GitHub, JIRA, Bugsnag) carries the same shape: *What changed* (Problem / Cause / Result / What I fixed, plus the conditional *Side benefit* / *Filed separately* fields), then *How to test*, then a closing line linking the PR and the source issue, plus any conditional *Clarifying questions* / *Assignment Compliance* blocks. The section headings and the field labels are part of the report's prose, so they are translated too — a Czech assignment renders *Co se změnilo* and *Jak otestovat*, never an English heading above Czech prose.

### How to detect the assignment language
1. Read the issue description and the most recent author-written comment off the deterministic loader (`skills/code-review-github/scripts/load-issue.sh` for GitHub, `skills/code-review-jira/scripts/load-issue.sh` for JIRA). The wording the reporter used there is the canonical signal.
2. When the issue body is empty or contains only a screenshot, fall back to the language of the linked JIRA ticket, the parent epic, or the PR description written by the same reporter.
3. When no signal is available, default to English and state the assumption in the published report's footer.

### Scope clarifications
- **This rule picks the language; `@rules/writing/general.md` shapes the sentences.** Once the language is settled here, the report is written in the simplified technical style that rule mandates — one idea per sentence, active voice, one term per concept — in that language, never only in English. The two rules never override each other: raise one finding per violation, and never a second finding on the same line for the sibling rule.
- **Code identifiers stay verbatim.** Class names, file paths, function names, error codes, enum cases, configuration keys, route paths, and similar machine-readable tokens keep their original form regardless of the surrounding prose language. Do not translate `App\Actions\ProcessPayment` into the assignment language. Quoting a code identifier inside an assignment-language sentence is not "mixing" — code is not a natural language.
- **PR titles and commit messages stay in English** per `@rules/git/general.md`. The language-matching rule applies to report bodies posted as comments / descriptions, not to git metadata.
- **In-conversation status, terminal output, and debug logs may stay in English.** Only tracker-facing reports follow the assignment language.
- **No bilingual parentheses.** Do not write *Kritické (Critical)* or *Závažné (Moderate)*. Either the whole comment is the English exception (so use *Critical / Moderate / Minor* directly), or the whole comment is in the assignment language (so use the assignment-language equivalent without an English gloss).

### Failure modes to avoid
- Posting a bilingual comment with the assignment language for prose and English in inline parentheses for severity labels or structural keywords.
- Translating the technical CR PR comment to Czech — the exception above keeps it English.
- Translating the non-technical issue / JIRA summary to English when the assignment is in Czech — the exception is narrow and does **not** cover those.
- Posting in the language of the agent's chat session instead of the language of the assignment.
- Switching mid-comment between Czech and English when quoting requirements verbatim — quote the requirement verbatim, then continue in the assignment language without a parenthetical translation.
